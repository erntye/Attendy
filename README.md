Attendance taking app using ambient noise recognition

This attendance-taking app seeks to prevent students from 'gaming' the system but ensuring that they have to be in class while submitting their attendance.

The app uses the Dejavu library to create a 'fingerprint' of the user's ambient sounds that will be compared against the fingerprint of the instructors to ensure that they are indeed in the same room.
